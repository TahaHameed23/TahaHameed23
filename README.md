## 👋 Hey, I'm Taha 

I'm a student from India pursuing undergraduate degree in computer science. I currently have experience with web technologies (full stack), primarily focused on backend development.

I enjoy working in the cloud ☁️, and I've developed and managed services and websites on a variety of cloud platforms.

I also love to work, develop and contribute in open source communities.
